                    <li>
                        To genuinely listen, understand and empathise respectfully with members of the public (remembering we were once non-vegans too), allowing us to engage them in meaningful conversation.

                    <li>
                        Communicating clearly and unapologetically about the ethics of animal use and the importance of veganism in creating a better future for all beings.

                    <li>
                        To showcase veganism in a positive manner by keeping our table attractive and engaging, provoking curiosity from the public allowing us to engage them further.

            <p>
            We greatly appreciate vegan food samples brought by activists, but please don't worry if you are unable to do so.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Lots of members of the public say they want to go vegan but love cheese and meat, so please bring tasty, accessible alternatives to cheese and meat or home baked goodies that look delicious to help the public overcome their concerns that vegan food is limiting or bland. Many people struggle with change, and showing the public that they can go vegan and still enjoy many of the things they currently do allows veganism to become achievable in their eyes. Here are some suggestions of what to bring:

            <div class="headerWrap"><p>What can I do to help?</p></div>
            <p>
            Please help in any way you feel comfortable with, this could include:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="center-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Arriving early to help bring our equipment to Market Street</li>

            <div class="headerWrap"><p>What should I say to the public?</p></div>
            <p>
            Approaching members of the public can be nerve-racking to begin with. Feel free to listen to other activists engaging with the public whilst you're gaining confidence. Most importantly, connect with members of the public in a genuine, respectful but honest, informative way, the same way you would have liked to have been spoken to when you were first interested in veganism. A good few opening questions to the public could be:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="center-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>"Are you interested in becoming vegan?"</li>
                    <li>"What's motivated your interest in becoming vegan?"</li>
                    <li>"How can we help you go vegan?"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <br/><br/>
            <div class="headerWrap"><p>Where can I share my ideas?</p></div>
            <p>
            Please send an email or a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterAnimalAction/">Facebook</a> message. We'd love to hear from you!
            <br/><br/>
            We welcome constructive criticism, however, we ask that anything you wish to share is communicated in a peaceful, respectful manner.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <div class="headerWrap"><p>Can I help the group in a different way?</p></div>
            <p>
            We aim to continually reflect upon and improve our event. If you have a skill you could use to help with our event, we'd love to hear about it, e.g. graphic design for new leaflets, photography, videography etc.
            <br/><br/>
            If you have any other questions, feel free to ask someone at the event or send us a message.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>BURNOUT</strong></h2>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Please look after yourself and others. Burn out can creep up unexpectedly. Activists can sometimes develop strong feelings of powerlessness to completely end animal cruelty. Our personal wellbeing is crucial for healthy, effective activism. We need to be able to remain calm but assertive and show non-vegans that weâ€™re fully rational, compassionate people who want to end violence towards animals. Please take regular breaks from activism and please talk to someone you trust if you need help, or reach out to '<a target="_blank" href="https://www.counsellingforsocialchange.org.uk/activists/">Counselling for Social Change</a>'.
